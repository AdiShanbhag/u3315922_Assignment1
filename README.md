# Automatic Pet Feeder System

Welcome to the repository for the **Automatic Pet Feeder System**, a smart solution designed to automate pet feeding with built-in alerts and monitoring. This project walks through the complete development lifecycleâ€”from problem identification to testing and refinement.

## Repository Structure

This project is organized into five key development stages:

### 1. Problem Solving
- **Objective**: Define the core problem and outline the goals of the automatic pet feeder.
- **Contents**: Problem statement, user needs, and system expectations.

### 2. Organising Data and Describing
- **Objective**: Identify and describe the key components and data involved.
- **Contents**: Inputs (e.g., time, food stock), outputs (e.g., alerts, feeding status), and system variables.

### 3. Flowchart
- **Objective**: Visualize the logical flow of the system.
- **Contents**: A step-by-step diagram showing decision points, actions, and alerts.

### 4. Word Coding
- **Objective**: Translate the flowchart into structured pseudocode.
- **Contents**: Enhanced word coding with clear logic and alert mechanisms.

### 5. Testing & Refining
- **Objective**: Simulate and evaluate system behavior, identify issues, and refine logic.
- **Contents**: Test cases, observations, and improvements made.

## Getting Started

To explore the project:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Start with the `Problem Solving` folder to understand the system's purpose.
3. Follow the folders sequentially to see how the idea evolves into a functional logic.
4. Review `Testing & Refining` to understand how the system was validated.

## Highlights

- Smart alert system for low food and motor issues.
- Consumption monitoring using bowl weight.
- Modular design for easy upgrades and sensor integration.

## Contributions

Feel free to fork the repo, suggest improvements, or adapt the system for your own pet care needs!
